Welcome to Basic Git Tutorial

Git is open source 
It is a Distributed version control System where each machine has its own local repository 
unlike to Centralized VCS(only a single server for all the machines)

Git maintains "Trunk Based Development"
where it stores all the versions by having master branch and separate branches based on requirement.

Commit is used to save the every change of a version
